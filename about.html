            Hi! My name is Clarissa Hoyt and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at
            Boston University. I grew up in southern California and attended St. John's Lutheran school for 
            elementary school through middle school and Villa Park for High School. <br>
            <br>
            I have swam for 15 years and currently swim for Boston University. I love going to the beach, surfing, 
            watching the sunset, and hiking.
        </p>
